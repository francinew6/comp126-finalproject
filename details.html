            <h2>Program Details</h2>
            <p>Organized by the Langfang Municipal Government (Langfang, Hebei Province, China) and funded by the Langfang University Alumni Foundation, a registered non-profit organization, this program offers a unique opportunity for US students to experience China firsthand. This immersive program goes beyond the typical tourist experience, delving deep into the vibrant cities of Langfang, Tianjin, and Beijing. Students will have the chance to explore iconic landmarks like the Great Wall of China and the Forbidden City and also discover hidden gems and local neighborhoods. The Langfang University Alumni Foundation, with its strong ties to the region, plays a vital role in facilitating authentic cultural interactions. Students will have the chance to connect with residents, university students, and cultural experts, fostering friendships and gaining a deeper understanding of Chinese traditions, history, and way of life. This exchange program is more than just sightseeing; it's a chance to broaden perspectives, build lasting connections, and create unforgettable memories that will bridge the gap between US and Chinese cultures.</p>
